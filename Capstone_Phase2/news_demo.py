cnn="""Tesla's "full self-driving" feature has attempted to drive under a railroad crossing arm while a speeding train passes. It's nearly driven head on into a concrete wall of a parking garage, attempted ill-advised left turns, clipped at least one curb, and at least one driver was able to set a maximum speed of 90 mph on a street where the posted speed limit was 35 mph, according to videos posted on social media.
These drivers knew they weren't using a foolproof system, and that there would be glitches as they had agreed to test early versions of the regularly updating "full self-driving" software for Tesla. The company warned them of limitations, and their need to be attentive.
Experts worry that the name of the feature implies a greater functionality than what Tesla is actually offering. But the risks of "full self-driving" don't appear to be holding Tesla back from a broad beta release of the feature. Tesla is preparing a wide rollout even as some of the Tesla loyalists testing the feature raise concerns about what will come next.
Some Tesla enthusiasts spoke out even before two people were killed in a Tesla over the weekend when it crashed into some trees. Police said that one occupant had been in the front passenger seat, and the other had been in one of the rear seats. There was no one in the driver's seat, the police said. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Monday that is investigating the crash.
Two people died in a Tesla crash in Spring, Texas, over the weekend.
The police statement that there was no driver behind the wheel suggests that Autopilot, the widely available precursor to "full self-driving," may have been active and, if so, was being used inappropriately.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Monday that data logs recovered so far show Autopilot was not enabled. But Musk did not rule out that future findings could reveal Autopilot was in use. He also did not share an alternative theory for the crash.
Tesla did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and generally does not engage with the professional news media"""
